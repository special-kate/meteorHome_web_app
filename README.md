## Contents:
- Form of create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations  
- The backend can be implemented using Nodejs/mongo or just use any open APIs  
- Project git repo should have two directories: one for UI (named webapp) and the other for backend (named server)

## Other Statement
    Weikai Chen do the login, register, profile and log out page and build the user database.
    Because there are too many rejections and conflicts at the beginning of the project.
    So I upload a folder called Archived2 in weikai-chen branch and merged by Yizhe.
    And a folder called Archive3 in master to prove my work.We can see that I contribute more than 10000 codes.
    It is the basement of our project.
    My teammate can prove that.
